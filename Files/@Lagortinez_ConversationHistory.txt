Here's an example code that makes a GET request to a sample API endpoint:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n\nprint(response.status_code)  # prints the HTTP response status code\n\nif response.ok:\n    print(response.json())  # prints the response JSON data\nelse:\n    print('Error:', response.status_code)\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using `requests.get(url)` to make a GET request to the API endpoint at `'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'`. We're printing the HTTP status code using `response.status_code`, and if the response is OK (status code 200), we're printing the JSON response data using `response.json()`. If there's an error, we're printing the status code."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '/language'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Python'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Give me a table of the last 10 US presidents.
